I've read the other members' solutions about this problem on projecteuler.net and I
discovered that IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT SMALLER. I'm sorry I wrote so much code but
I thought it was the simplest way for both reading and writing it. I feel bad now, not
just because it was MUCH LONGER, but because I wasted time writing something too long.
Sorry again.
